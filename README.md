Portfolio Project

Overview
This portfolio project is designed to showcase my skills and work in UI/UX design, sound design, and web development. The portfolio features a responsive design with smooth animations, a back-to-top button, and a dark mode toggle. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my abilities in these areas.
